# Enhanced-Intrusion-Detection-Model-Based-on-Improved-Swin-Transformer
To overcome limitations in feature representation, multidimensional extraction, and generalization of existing intrusion detection models, we propose an enhanced Swin Transformer-based framework. 

1.Due to confidentiality requirements and lack of full authorization, we have substituted and obfuscated part of the engineering code. The reason why we still strive to make this part public is to enable readers to understand our technology and apply it to the development of intrusion detection systems for critical infrastructure in their own countries. We have minimized the impact of such processing on the model as much as possible.

2.We are actively negotiating to obtain full authorization for the dataset we have collected and to upload it to the open-source community. However, this is a rather complex task because the dataset contains sensitive data collected from China's national critical information infrastructure. To safeguard public security and personal privacy, we may need to engage in complex consultations and undertake certain processing before making it public.
